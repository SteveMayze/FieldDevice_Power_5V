# Field Device 5V Power
6V-18V to 5V Power Regulator

## Overview
This project is a power regulator to take from 6-18V DC and convert this to 5V up to 2A. The design is based on the TI TPS54232 and was designed with the TI WEBENCHÂ® (design  4530725/56 TPS54232DR).

The field device power is to provide a constant 5V supply to a field sensor that could be powered from a solar charger. Provision has been made in the circuit for a 6V alkaline backup battery. This provides a short-lived backup mechansim for the field device to take care of any clean up and alert tasks before having to shut down.
